## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API Error**
   - Check your API key is correct in `.env.local`
   - Verify you have credits in your OpenAI account
   - Ensure the environment variable name is exactly `OPENAI_API_KEY`

2. **Port Already in Use**
   - The app is configured to run on port 3090
   - If you need a different port, update the scripts in `package.json`

3. **Build Errors**
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Check that TypeScript types are properly imported

### Testing Amo

Try these example prompts:
- "I need a pickleball paddle"
- "Help me choose a couch for my living room"
- "Looking for a stroller for my newborn"

Amo will:
1. Ask diagnostic questions to understand your needs
2. Show you visual examples and comparisons
3. Teach you about price tiers and features
4. Give you personalized recommendations
5. Help you make the final decision

Watch for "Show image:" directives - Amo will search and display relevant product images!
